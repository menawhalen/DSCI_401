    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Python?\n",
    "Python is a versatile programming language known for its readability and wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis. It's often the first choice for beginners due to its simple syntax and extensive community support.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is JupyterLab?\n",
    "JupyterLab is the next-generation web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. It extends the classic Jupyter Notebook interface with flexible layouts, file browsers, terminals, and rich support for many file types — all inside a single integrated workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Jupyter Ecosystem (“JupyterVerse”)\n",
    "Jupyter is more than just notebooks — it’s a whole ecosystem of tools designed to make interactive computing easier and more productive:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook: The original web app for interactive coding in notebooks.\n",
    "- JupyterLab: A powerful, flexible interface that builds on notebooks with IDE-like features.\n",
    "- JupyterHub: A multi-user server for running Jupyter for teams or classrooms on shared infrastructure.\n",
    "- Jupyter Kernels: Language backends that run your code — Python is the most common, but kernels exist for R, Julia, and many others.\n",
    "- nbconvert: A tool to convert notebooks to HTML, PDF, slides, and more.\n",
    "- Voila: Turn notebooks into standalone web apps without code cells visible.\n",
    "- Quarto: A publishing system built on Jupyter and Pandoc, letting you create scientific documents, presentations, and websites from .qmd files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "- Multi-Document Interface: Work with multiple notebooks, terminals, text editors, and output panels side by side.\n",
    "- Extensible: Install extensions for Git integration, debugging, variable inspectors, and more.\n",
    "- Supports Notebooks and More: Open .ipynb notebooks, Markdown files, CSVs, JSON, images, and even Quarto .qmd documents.\n",
    "- Code Consoles: Run snippets interactively without cluttering your notebooks.\n",
    "- Real-Time Collaboration: Some extensions enable live sharing and collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Get Started with Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "How to Get Started with JupyterLab\n",
    "1. Installing JupyterLab Locally\n",
    "If you haven’t installed JupyterLab yet, you can do so with either pip or download:\n",
    "- Install via pip:\n",
    "Ensure Python is installed on your system (Python 3.x is recommended).\n",
    "Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "Run the command: pip install jupyterlab\n",
    "Start Jupyter Lab by typing jupyter lab in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Creating and Activating Your Virtual Environment\n",
    "We recommend creating a dedicated environment for the class to keep dependencies organized. From your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "Activate it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "Windows (PowerShell): venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "\n",
    "Install required packages inside your environment (using a provided requirements.txt): pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Linking Your Environment to JupyterLab\n",
    "Register your environment as a kernel so you can select it inside JupyterLab:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name=dsci401 --display-name \"Python (DSCI 401)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Launch JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "Select Jupter icon and select open.. Open the class file folder and select the Python (DSCI 401) kernel from the top-right dropdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended Workflow\n",
    "- Organization: Keep your work organized by creating folders for each project.\n",
    "- Saving Work: Save your notebook frequently with Ctrl + S or Cmd + S.\n",
    "- Using Markdown: Use Markdown cells to document your code and explain your analysis.\n",
    "- Shortcuts: Get familiar with Jupyter shortcuts like Shift + Enter to run cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Packages\n",
    "In Python, **packages** are collections of modules that provide additional functionality and tools, making it easier to perform specific tasks without having to write code from scratch. A package typically contains various functions, classes, and variables that you can use directly by importing the package into your Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some commonly used packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`math`**: This package provides mathematical functions and constants, such as `sqrt` for square roots, `sin` for sine functions, and `pi` for the constant π.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`numpy`**: Short for Numerical Python, this package is essential for scientific computing. It offers support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide variety of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`pandas`**: This package is widely used for data manipulation and analysis. It allows for easy handling of structured data through its powerful data structures like DataFrames, which are similar to tables in a database or Excel spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Kernel and Why Does It Matter?\n",
    "When you run Python code in JupyterLab (or any Jupyter interface), it runs inside a kernel — a computational engine that executes your code and keeps track of all variables and imports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each kernel is tied to a specific Python environment, meaning it only has access to the packages installed in that environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why:\n",
    "- If you open a notebook and use a kernel linked to a virtual environment where numpy or pandas is not installed, you will get an error when you try to import those packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conversely, if you select the kernel connected to the environment where all required packages are installed (like the Python (DSCI 401) kernel we set up), your notebook will run smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How This Works in This Course\n",
    "- You will create a dedicated Python environment for this class (using venv or Conda).\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will install the packages we use (e.g., numpy, pandas) inside this environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will register this environment as a kernel named Python (DSCI 401).\n",
    "\n",
    "When working in JupyterLab, always select this kernel for your notebooks to ensure you have access to all the packages you need."

    "\n",
    "## Understanding File Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, working with different file formats is a common task, especially when dealing with data analysis and storage. Here are some of the most common file types you might encounter:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **CSV Files**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are plain text files used to store tabular data. They are widely used because they are simple and can be easily read and written by both humans and machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Example operations include reading a CSV file into a DataFrame and saving a DataFrame to a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **JSON Files**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files are used to store and exchange data in a lightweight and human-readable format. JSON is often used for transmitting data in web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Python allows you to easily read data from a JSON file and write data back into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Pickle Files**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Pickle is a Python-specific format used to serialize and deserialize Python objects. This format is useful for saving complex data structures like DataFrames or custom Python objects, so they can be easily loaded back into your program later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an illustrative example in Python (written as comments for explanation):"

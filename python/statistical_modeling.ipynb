Type II sums of squares are common when factors are balanced (equal sample sizes across groups) or when there are no significant interactions.\n","\n","- Type III (`typ=3`): This type calculates the \"marginal\" sums of squares, meaning it tests each factor’s effect while controlling for all other factors, including interactions.
